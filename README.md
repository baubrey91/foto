## Functionality

The following is how to use:

Tap on faces to put a blur on them.
In settings select the color of the blur and whether you want it to be square or circular.
Use the slider to adjust the intensity of the blur.
Import your own photo from your photo library, or take a picture.
Save the photo to your library.

Blur uses facial recognition to determine where to make adjustments to the image.
